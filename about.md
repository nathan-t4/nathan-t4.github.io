## About

Hi! My name is Nathan, and I am an upcoming mechanical engineering graduate (B.S.) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC, 2019/08-2022/05). During my undergrad, I joined the RoboDesign Lab as an undergraduate research assistant, where I am  developing a force-sensing foot for humanoid robots. My current interests are in robotics and mechaincal design, but I am also eager to learn about much more.

During my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and reading.
