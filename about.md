## About

Hi! My name is Nathan, and I am an upcoming mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC, 2019/08-2022/05). During my undergrad, I was fortunate to join the RoboDesign Lab as an undergraduate research assistant, where I am currently developing a force-sensing foot for humanoid robots. My current interests are in robotics and mechaincal design, but I am eager learn about much more. <br>
During my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and reading.
